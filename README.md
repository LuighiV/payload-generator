# Payload generator

This repository has the aim to generate a payload for LoRaWAN devices
via two methods: random values and OpenWeather data.

## How to use

To use this package you should import it via:
```go
import (
	"github.com/LuighiV/payload-generator/generator"
)
```

In the folder `examples` there is an example that uses both the random
generation and the OpenWeather API data.

### Random generation

To use the random generation you should create the generator with an option to
populate Random Base values, then you could generate it and print with a
function from the generator struct.

```go
	gen, err := generator.NewGenerator(
		generator.WithRandomBase(
			39.0, 	// temperature base
			80.0,   // humidity base
			1000.0, // pressure base
			0.5,    // temperature variation
			5,      // humidity variation
			100,    // pressure variation
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	generator.Generate(generator.Random)(gen)
	fmt.Println(generator.GetPayload(gen))
```

The resulting values are the temperature, humidity and pressure as integers
multiplied by 100, to get the two most significant decimals.

The random generation is a result from:
```
generated_value = base_value - variation/2 + random*variation
```

### OpenWeather generation

To use this generation you should provide the API Key and the City from which
you want to obtain the weather data.

```go
	gen, err := generator.NewGenerator(
		generator.WithOWeatherConfig(
			"OW_API_KEY", // replace by your API Key
			"London",     // replace by the city of interest
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	generator.Generate(generator.OpenWeather)(gen)
	fmt.Println(generator.GetPayload(gen))
```

The program uses the API Key to connect to the OpenWeather service and retrieve
the actual weather information.

The information generated in the payload is: temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed,
latitude and longitud, in that order.

### Using example

To use the example you should provide the API Key as an environment variable `OW_API_KEY`
otherwise you will get empty values for that generator. That variable could be
declared in line with the command, as follows:

```bash
OW_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxx go run main.go
```
